            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>TMI's services can make an immediate difference to how you experience your information and your digital devices, but that's not the only goal. Digital files are highly impermanent, and the information they contain often needs to last much longer than a digital device. You may have the experience of doing some digital spring cleaning, enjoying the benefits for a few months, before falling behind again.</p>
            <p>The goal of TMI's services to address your information needs in the present and to set you up to meet those needs for the next ten years. No scheme is perfect, but TMI's services will allow you to manage your information efficiently and incrementally. No more spring cleaning or lengthy migrations, no more painful deletions or outdated versions. Just personal information, preserved, efficient, and sensible.</p>

            <h2>Take the Diagnostic</h2>
            <p>All TMI sessions begin with a diagnostic and service recommendation. TMI uses two diagnostic techniques: critical incident and "the timer."</p>
            <p>When you contact TMI, you will be asked to do a critical incident diagnostic.</p>
            <p><b>Critical Incident</b></p>
            <p>The critical incident diagnostic asks you to reflect on an incident where your information strategies resulted in a meaningful failure. The failure may be extreme, or it may have been a significant waste of time. Any unpleasant event caused by a failure of your information to work for you can be considered a critical incident. In the case where you're concerned a pattern of events, try to think of a specific time the pattern occurred.
